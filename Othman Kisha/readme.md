This is the submission for COE 445 assignment 5.

Notes:
    1- I recommend that you start registering a resident, visitor and security officer.
    2- a fake gmail account of VMS Security is used to send email, you can change it.
    3- if you created a visit in visitor account, the visitor will also receive an email.
    4- resident will always receive an email.
    5- when a new visit is created, the system will direct you to the page of the visit.
    6- there you can see the reservation number.

#Important: You Should add a record to the collection(using mongoDB compass or manually) with id: "visitID" and sequence_value: 1,
this is for auto incrementing the database.
